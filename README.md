# CNN_lingonberry_binary_keras
 Binary classification of lingon berries or not-lingonberries using Keras.

Based on the assignment "Keras tutorial - Emotion Detection in Images of Faces" by Andrew Ng (Deeplearning.ai) within the Cousera course Deep Learning Specialization.

The purpose of the model is, by a binary classification model, select if there is a lingonberry (label: lingon) or not a lingonbberry(label:icke-lingon) from images. The model is a to be used as a proof of a concept to use ML in the wooberry industry like in the process of picking and cleansing berries.

The datasets is a subset of the Woodberry Dataset. The subset contains images of lingonberries, and others berries and scrap.
